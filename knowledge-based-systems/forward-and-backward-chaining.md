<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Forward And Backward Chaining -->

# Notes
* [Modus Ponens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhH9i47YFHQ)
	* Latin for "The way that affirms by affirming"
	* 


* [First: Inference Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwcNDKXcHU)
	* Inference: coming to a conclusion/decision
	* Inference Engine: **applies logical rules to the Knowledge base to deduce information**.
	* Two Modes: 
		* ![Infengine](/uploads/images/infengine.png "Infengine")
		* **Forward Chaining: asserts new facts with known facts**
		* **Backward Chaining: works backward to determine what facts must be asserted so that goals can be achieved.**

	* **Data driven approach**
	* **Process of making a decision with known/available data**
	* **Data ----> Decision**
	* Example is on linked video.

* [Backward Chaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5O8QAWu-OM)
	* **decision/goal driven inference technique**
	* initial state is fetched based on the decision
	* searches relevent data for the decsion
	* **Decision ----> Data**
