# Virtual Machine
Install Windows XP on Virtual Machine.

* I happened to install windows XP on VirtualBox, but couldn't get the files transfered so I installed it on VMware Player.

Step 1: to get MCC setup files into C: Drive of virtual machine.
Step 2: copy all files to a folder "DISK1"
Step 3: Run the installer.

# Installation
* run the setup file from DISK1
* Error 1: Shared folder, leave it blank.
* If that doesn't work, create a folder and put the path of the folder.
* ![Sharedmcc](/uploads/sharedmcc.png "Sharedmcc")
