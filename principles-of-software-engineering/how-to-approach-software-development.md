<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of How To Approach Software Development -->

# Interesting Questions
1. which S/W system categories dominate the market? i.e where the money and the jobs tend to be?
2. what S/W skills are needed? 
3. need DB back-end?
4. which programming language?
5. what support tech > tools required?

# Software Dev Paradigms
* focus of different appoach to schedule of different activities involved in Software Development
* no single theoritical model/paradigm actually works in every circumstance.

# Inception
* focus mostly on (but not only)
	* Bussiness modeling 
	* Requirements extraction and analysis
	* Preliminary design

# SD: From art to engineering
## 1.1 S/W systems vs H/W

|S/W Engineer Viewpoint|H/W Engineer Viewpoint|
|:-----------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|
|systems are mostly s/w systems|systems are traditionally h/w systems|
|h/w component is controlled through standard interfacing protocols|s/w are either not existing or not extremely relevent|

* Until few years ago, computing foccussed on data processing systems.
* H/W were limited to the standard I/O devices.
* H/W is currently capable of providing structured data through pluggable software drivers that represent the real interfacing protocol for the system developers.

| H/W Failure curve | S/W (IDEALIZED) Failure curve |

* **Actual S/W Curve**
* ![Swafrc](/uploads/swafrc.png "Swafrc")
*  S/W engineering/development intriduces quality problems based on its complexity (***that do not exist in classic manufacturing.***)
